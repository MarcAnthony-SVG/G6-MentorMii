## Codebase Overview

The deep-dive codebase is broken into two major pieces: the client and the server. The codebase has three separate package.json files and you will need to validate existing scripts and write new ones which are able to easily move between the top layer of the repo and the two lower layers to help you manage your Node packages.

### Challenges

<ul>
<li> Implementing unfamiliar technologies like bootstrap</li>
<li> Integrating server routes while using React router</li>
